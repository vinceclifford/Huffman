# Huffman

This is an implmentation of Huffmans-Enkoding. The Kompression of an arbitrary file is done losslessly through prefix codes. Any file format can be compressed through this implementation. A compressed file will be stored in a so-called Huffman-File (.huff) and can be decoded with this program. There are a staggering amount of minute optimization to ensure optimal runtime and maximal kompression ratio.
